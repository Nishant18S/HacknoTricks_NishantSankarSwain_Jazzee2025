## 🔍 Problem Statement

Over 70% of India's population resides in rural and semi-urban areas, where citizens often struggle to access public services due to language barriers, low digital literacy, and bureaucratic red tape. Current grievance redressal mechanisms and scheme portals are predominantly English-based and inaccessible to non-technical users, resulting in underutilized benefits, unresolved issues, and lack of trust in governance.
